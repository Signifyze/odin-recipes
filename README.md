# odin-recipes

This is a project to build a basic recipe website using HTML.

What this project has taught me:
- This has been good practice for writing an HTML boilerplate.
- Gotten used to adding links and images to a page (and remembering to add alt text!).
- Starting to get used to the workflow of using Git.
- Made me think about how to write good commit messages.
- Also just getting used to writing HTML in general (lists, headers etc.).
- How to add bullet points to README.md.
